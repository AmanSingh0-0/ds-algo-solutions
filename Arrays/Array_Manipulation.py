#Required Knowledge:  Sorting, Implementation

#You are given a list of size n, initialized with zeroes.
#You have to perform m queries on the list and output the maximum of final values of all the n elements in the list. 
#For every query, you are given three integers a, b and k and you have to add value k to all the elements ranging from index a to b(both inclusive).
